    "In this notebook is the first project of the summer, where the main goal is to become more comforatble with using packages like yfinance, pandas, and matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 goals of this project are to:\n",
    "* Write code to fetch P/E Ratio, Market Cap, and Company Name for one ticker\n",
    "* Print the results cleanly\n",
    "* Understand what each value means and how it's structured\n",

    "Some sub goals for myself are making sure that this code is written cleanly, and taking care and pride in this work. I have been reading Steve Job's biography, and onething that he preached was putting care into all aspects of a project, even that parts that can't be seen. In this case that will be formatting and commenting my code, as well as trying to make the UI as userfriendly as possible."
